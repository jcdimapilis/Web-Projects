Report by: Dimapilis (Leader)

*Work is effecient, we had difficulty in animation but after understanding the parameters of the drawImage() function, it was less difficult.

*There were no problems / issues with working with my groupmate Danica

Assignment of Tasks:

Since there are only two of us in the group we equally distributed the work to each of us. I, Joshua did mostly of the images of Pabu, Flabby, The Dog, Dara and his Brother, with the help of an outside friend, for the animation using Illustrator. I also had to finish the scene pages for the Chapter 1 (Scenes 1 and 2)Chapters 3, 5, 7 and 8.

For Danica, she was able to finish most of the tasks that we assigned to her. She was responsible for doing the Welcome Page, the About Page and the Table of Contents. Also, she finished the Scene Pages for the Chapters 2,4 and 6 and edited the initial pages of Chapter 1 (Scenes 1 - 4).
